**Action 2: Push the Fix to GitHub**
Now that you have the corrected file on your local machine, we need to upload it to your GitHub repository so that Render can see the fix.

1.  Open your terminal in your `F1_Career_Project` folder.
2.  Run the following commands one by one:
    * **Add the changed file:**
      ```bash
      git add requirements.txt
      ```
    * **Commit the fix with a message:**
      ```bash
      git commit -m "Fix requirements.txt for deployment"
      ```
    * **Push the change to GitHub:**
      ```bash
      git push
