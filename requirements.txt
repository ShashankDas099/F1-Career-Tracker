**Action 2: Push the Final Fix to GitHub**
Now that you have the correct file, you just need to upload this one last fix to your GitHub repository. This will trigger a new deployment on Render, which will finally succeed.

Please run these three commands in your terminal, one by one:

1.  **Add the corrected file:**
    ```bash
    git add requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Commit the fix:**
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Final fix for requirements.txt format"
    ```

3.  **Push the fix to GitHub:**
    ```bash
    git push
